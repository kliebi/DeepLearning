# DeepLearning

1. implement a function that explores the VAE latent space and visualise the grid (20x20) of the latent space (MNIST)
2. compare latent spaces of AE and VAE
3. (AE and VAE) select an encoder layer (2nd or 3rd) and a channel in this layer. Then generate / find a dream image for the selected channel in the selected layer.
